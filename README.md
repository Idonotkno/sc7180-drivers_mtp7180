## English
 ## source
 All files in the repo are extracted from the MTP7180 engineering verification board.

 ## brief description
 The file comes from a board I encountered by chance. It is a test verification version of a test board of a Windows project of Qualcomm. It is not an official support device of Qualcomm. For SC7180, Qualcomm supports IDP and cls for it.  cls is customized for notebooks, and IDP is derived from a branch of MTP. MTP7180 support has been removed in the new version.
 ## use
 So this driver is also very rare. It can theoretically support mobile devices rather than notebooks. You can refer to it to a certain extent and refer to your own development, which will be of great help.
 ## Terms Statement
 To a certain extent, this reference project is for learning and reference only. It does not allow any non-licensed commercial use. The attribution of rights is still reserved for Qualcomm Technologies and Microsoft. Any non-licensed commercial behavior will have nothing to do with the publisher.  Violators shall bear all legal consequences, and Qualcomm and Microsoft reserve the right to interpret the document.

## 简体中文(Chinese)
## 来源
仓库中所有文件均为MTP7180工程验证板中提取。
## 简述
文件来自偶然遇到的一个板，它非常偶然，是高通的一个Windows项目的测试板中的测试验证版本，它并不是高通官方的支持设备，对于SC7180,高通为它的支持是IDP和cls，cls为笔记本所定制，IDP则源于MTP的分支，MTP7180支持已经在新的版本中移除。
## 用途
所以这份驱动也是很稀有的东西，它在理论上可以很好的支持于移动设备而不是笔记本，你可以进行相当程度的参考，并对自己的开发进行参考，会有很大帮助。
